Text:
Girsa of beracha of mekadeish hashabbat--add ungrammatical version in footnote
Add Yah Eli piyyut
Determine kaddish girsa
Add Bei Ana
Spelling of "mesharatav" in birchot K"Sh, and similar gutteral letters with a shva na (e.g. barekhu)
Decide if I'm adding "reishit chochma"

Typographical stuff:
Some shva-marks still doubled (see aleinu, omer)
Fix last vowel of Yerushalayim
Script output a list of words that may or may not have kamatz katans (kamatz followed by shva) for manual checking

Formatting:
Shabbat mincha kedusha is screwed up
Bentshing (bamarom) has messed up formatting
Blank pages around barekhu, after weekday shacharit amidah
Get rid of dots (see right after Shema)
Bilingual instructions
Rashi script for instructions
Stretchy letters
Bold for shva na'

Other:
Come up with a name
Reorganize so Yom-Tov doesn't have so much skipping around--in progress
