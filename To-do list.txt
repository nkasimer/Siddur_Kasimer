Text:
Additional verse in Tachanun
Girsa of beracha of mekadeish hashabbat--add ungrammatical version in footnote
Move yom-tov stuff around
Add bracha for tallit katan

Typographical stuff:
Some "kols" not fixed
Some kamatzes still doubled (see modim)
Some shva-marks still doubled (see aleinu)
Script output a list of words that may or may not have kamatz katans (kamatz followed by shva) for manual checking (includining when the shva is marked already)

Formatting:
Bilingual instructions
Rashi script for instructions
Stretchy letters
Bold for shva na'

Other:
Write introduction
Come up with a name
Reorganize so Yom-Tov doesn't have so much skipping around
