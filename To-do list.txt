Text:
Girsa of beracha of mekadeish hashabbat--add ungrammatical version in footnote
Add Yah Eli piyyut
Fix kaddish
Add Bei Ana

Typographical stuff:
Some "kols" not fixed
Some kamatzes still doubled (see modim)
Some shva-marks still doubled (see aleinu)
Script output a list of words that may or may not have kamatz katans (kamatz followed by shva) for manual checking (includining when the shva is marked already)

Formatting:
Bilingual instructions
Rashi script for instructions
Stretchy letters
Bold for shva na'
Shabbat mincha kedusha is screwed up
Bentshing (bamarom) has messed up formatting

Other:
Come up with a name
Reorganize so Yom-Tov doesn't have so much skipping around--in progress
