We also present new ways of obtaining wave-speed estimates. The resulting solver is as accurate and robust as the exact Riemann solver, but it is simpler and computationally more efficient than the latter, particulaly for non-ideal gases. The improved Riemann solver is implemented in the second-order WAF method and tested for one-dimensional problems with exact solutions and for a two-dimensional problem with experimental results.",
